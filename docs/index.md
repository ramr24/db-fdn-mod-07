# Assignment 07 â€“ Write-up
Details: 
1. Explain when you would use a SQL UDF.
2. Explain the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.

### Introduction
In this assignment, I will explain when to use a SQL UDF. Finally, I will explain the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.

### SQL UDF
User Defined Functions (UDFs) are custom functions created by the user. There are two basic types of functions which return a table of values or return a single value. UDFs are very useful to use when you are outputting values due to repetitive lines of code. A function can be created with parameters to reduce redundancy in your code. The UDF can be used to output different results by changing a different value to the parameter rather than write large statements to return the same output.

### Differences between Scalar, Inline and Multi-Statement Functions
Scalar user defined functions return a single value. An inline function would have returned a scalar value in the form of a single statement. A multi-statement function can return any data type and would return a series of statements that return a single value. 

### Summary
UDFs are custom functions created by the user to return a table of values or return a single value. Scalar UDFs return a single value, inline functions return a single statement and multi-statement functions returns a table.
